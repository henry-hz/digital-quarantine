Stop Corona Virus
=================



How to use AI + Blockchain to stop corona virus?


Upload last phone calls from every person that was contamined, and based on the
day the first symtopms appeard, trace back for the last 12 days [the time the
virus take to incubate] all the people that maybe had a contact with the
infected person. The ideia is to create a rank for every app user, indicating
the probability that he was infected.

Instead of using massive quarantine, governments will be able to isolate people
that have a real chance to be infected.

Using neural nets to train the model, and blockchain to keep all data private,
so every smartphone creates a encrypted profile, and send the data to this smart
contract.

Geo position is also an amazing input.

Think about a "Waze" of the virus spreading, a collaborative mode.



## Inputs

* Date and time the person was contacted
* Work address
* Home address
* Family and best friends list
* Trace back last geo position (from Apple/Google)



## Model

Should predict the proability of the user to be infected, and based on the
threshoud, this person should be quarantined, using ABM (agent based modeling),
we should also forecast the power of the virus dispersion.


## Ouputs

* Probability of being infected.
* Probability of infect other people
* Network of people that he know is under high risk (so he can contact them)
