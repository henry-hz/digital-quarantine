Digital Quarantine Protocol
===========================

UPDATE: The Israeli health ministry just launched a contact tracking with local
GPS data storage [here](https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native)

Instead of physically imposing isolation to every person, business and family, my proposal (with the help of God), is that every person should create a clear and repetitive pattern of movement, and any change on this pattern, should also change the risk level of the person and his network, alleviating the economic burden of stopping every economic field.

To solve the privacy concern, let's use blockchain to encrypt, anonymize and share data.

## Cluster and City Isolation

To optimize economic activities, and avoid a full lockdown, we should aim to isolate healthy cities, to not become contaminated and also isolate contaminated cities, in order to avoid contamination to other cities. Once cities need to receive and send products, a buffer zone should be created in order to avoid contamination, i.e. trucks depoisit food into the city's buffer, and the respective city supermarket truck will load the deposited food to bring it to the super market.


## Data Collection

Users will upload every data that can be used to trace his network and physical
movement.



**Mobile Users Data**

* GPS position: Upload their GPS to the blockchain database.
* Telehpone calls: Upload phone list calls
* List of friends and common visited places
* Bluetooth radar: In every physical approximation, a bluetooth will send the user UUID to other users, so we can trace contacts inside any building.
* Corona Symptoms Updates: (Fever, difficult of breathing, etc...): Upload any sign of a Corona symptom.
* Age, health conditions, etc...: The user profile is an important factor to define if the user can spread the virus without having symptoms.

**Govs**

* List of infected users
* GEO positions and time of infected users, example:

- passengers on flight LY381 on February 21, which took off from Israel at 6:00a.m., and passengers on flight LY385 which landed in Israel on February 23 at 4:10p.m.;
- the "Hapirat Ha'adom" (red pirate) toy store in Or Yehuda, on Sunday, February 23 between 6:00-10:00p.m.; on Monday, February 24 between 8:30a.m. and midnight; and on Tuesday, February 25, between 8:30a.m. and midnight;
- at the synagogue on Noga Street in Moshav Irus, on February 24, between the hours of 6:00-7:00a.m.



## Data Processing

* Cross infected user tracing contacts retroactively and alert users that their
    risk level changed.
* Optimize user risk levels dynamically
* Change recomendations dynamically, depending on their risk level, i.e. high
    risk users will receive new recomendations, depending on the spreading
    level, optimization targets, age, and other factors.
* User risk meeting modeling: users will be able to see the risk level of other
    users.



## Outputs

* Every user will receive a risk level rank, dynamically and in real time
* Depending on the risk level, AI optimization will soften of open movement,
    i.e. high risk should be at home, medium risk, only to use car, and go to
    buy in specific stores, low risk, sit with until 5 people together.
* Augmented reality: users will be able to see other users rank, and keep the
    correct distance, depending on the risk they want to get.
