Digital Quarantine Protocol
===========================

Instead of physically imposing isolation to every person, business and family, my proposal (with the help of God), is that every person should create a clear and repetitive pattern of movement, and any change on this pattern, should also change the risk level of the person and his network, alleviating the economic burden of stopping every economic field.

To solve the privacy concern, let's use blockchain to encrypt, anonymize and
share data.



## Data Collection

Users will upload every data that can be used to trace his network and physical
movement.



** Mobile Users **

* GPS position
* Telehpone calls
* List of friends and common visited places
* Bluetooth
* Corona Symptoms (Fever, difficult of breathing, etc...)
* Age, health conditions, etc...


** Govs **

* List of infected users
* GEO positions and time of infected users, example:

- passengers on flight LY381 on February 21, which took off from Israel at 6:00a.m., and passengers on flight LY385 which landed in Israel on February 23 at 4:10p.m.;
- the "Hapirat Ha'adom" (red pirate) toy store in Or Yehuda, on Sunday, February 23 between 6:00-10:00p.m.; on Monday, February 24 between 8:30a.m. and midnight; and on Tuesday, February 25, between 8:30a.m. and midnight;
- at the synagogue on Noga Street in Moshav Irus, on February 24, between the hours of 6:00-7:00a.m.



## Data Processing

* Cross infected user tracing contacts retroactively and alert users that their
    risk level changed.
* Optimize user risk levels dynamically
* Change recomendations dynamically, depending on their risk level, i.e. high
    risk users will receive new recomendations, depending on the spreading
    level, optimization targets, age, and other factors.
* User risk meeting modeling: users will be able to see the risk level of other
    users.



## Outputs

* Every user will receive a risk level rank, dynamically and in real time
* Depending on the risk level, AI optimization will soften of open movement,
    i.e. high risk should be at home, medium risk, only to use car, and go to
    buy in specific stores, low risk, sit with until 5 people together.
* Augmented reality: users will be able to see other users rank, and keep the
    correct distance, depending on the risk they want to get.
